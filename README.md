# rpgax

Welcome to rpgax! This is like a Rogue-like, dungeon-crawler RPG… or something… I'm not too sure what the genre is, I just had fun making it!

## What is rpgax?
"rpgax" is short for "Role Playing Game ASCII"
ASCII basically just means "text" (you can look it up), so "rpgax" kind of just means "text-based adventure". The name takes inspiration from the short-hand naming conventions when working with the Terminal that I've been learning about while going through my Software Development college classes.
I really didn't have a name for the game when I first started making it, and now I just like the look of it.
This game was made using C++, XCode, GitHub and VIM!
