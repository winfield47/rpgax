# Text-based Adventure

Welcome to rpgax! This is a text-based, rogue-like, dungeon-crawler RPG or something…

## What is rpgax?
rpgax is short for "Role Playing Game ASCII"

*ASCII* basically just means *text* <sub>just look it up</sub>, so "rpgax" kind of just means "text-based adventure". The name takes inspiration from the short-hand naming conventions when working with the Terminal that I've been learning about while going through my Software Development college classes. I really didn't have a name for the game when I first started making it, and now I just like the look of it.

This game was made using C++, XCode, GitHub and VIM!
