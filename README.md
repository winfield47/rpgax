# An ASCII RPG

Welcome to rpgax! This is a text-based, rogue-like, dungeon-crawler RPG or something…

## What is rpgax?
**rpgax** is short-hand for **Role Playing Game ASCII**

The name takes inspiration from the short-hand naming conventions when working with the Terminal that I've been learning about while going through my Software Development college classes. I really didn't have a name for the game when I first started making it, and now I just like the look of it.

**ax** represents **ascii** : When putting an 'x' after the first letter of a word, the rest of the word is assumed. 

**ASCII** just means **text** : ASCII is a standard data-encoding format for electronic communication between computers.

**RPG** usually implies **Adventure** : RPG usually means you have some kind of stats, leveled-gear and character building while progressing through an adventure.

So all together, **rpgax** represents the meaning of **Text-based Adventure**
